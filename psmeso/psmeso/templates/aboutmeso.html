    "Poesis spinea" is a Latin approximation of "spiny poetry." I hope I got it
    right, because I like the name. A mesostic is a type of chance-operation
    poem invented by John Cage (yes, that John Cage). The poem has a "spine" of
    capitalized letters down the middle (like an acrostic has a spine down the
    left).
</p>
<p>
    It is generated by "reading through" a source text with a chosen word or
    phrase that will be the spine of the completed poem. Words included must
    follow a few rules, below. The spine text is often the name of the source
    text's author or of the mesostic's creator.
</p>
<p>
    Criteria of a mesostic:
    <ol>
        <li>Between 2 spine letters, neither letter may appear in lowercase;</li>
        <li>Limit of 45 characters left of the spine, same to the right;</li>
        <li>(Cage: "Then I take out the words I don't want."<br />
            My interp: Don't add all possible words between spine letters.)</li>
    </ol>
</p>
<!-- # Commented out because it is not a pure mesostic; was made on mesostomatic--too bad.
<p>
    Example (source text is Rae Armantrout's "The Way"):
</p>
<pre>
              pe<b>W</b>
                <b>A</b>nnounces
               o<b>N</b>ly
              ba<b>D</b>
            wint<b>E</b>r
              wo<b>R</b>d
                <b>I</b>s
             sce<b>N</b>es
                <b>G</b>asp
</pre>-->
<p>
    P.S. generates a mesostic from the source & spine text you enter; if it
    cannot finish, it prints a message and the incomplete result. But if it can
    complete a mesostic with one copy of your spine text (plus the first letter
    again), it should be able to make one with as many copies as you like (up to
    99, for practical reasons).
</p>
<p>
    A true mesostic would use a word no more times than it occurs in the
    oracle; this program may, however, when it has to loop back to the
    beginning to find suitable words.
